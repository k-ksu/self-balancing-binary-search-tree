see task-description.pdf

Built-in sorting algorithms are not allowed, developers have to implement sorting themselves if needed.

Unless stated otherwise, any algorithm/data structure can be used to solve the exercise, as long as it is implemented by the developer.

You are allowed to use std::vector and std::list in C++ as well as ArrayList and LinkedList in Java.

You must implement and use Merge-Sort, Quick-Sort, or Heap-Sort.

You must implement and use an AVL tree, Red-Black tree, 2-3 tree, or B-tree.

Implemented data structures must be generic over the type of keys.
